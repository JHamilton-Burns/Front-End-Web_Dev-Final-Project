# Project 3 WIP Check-in
## Milestone 2
### INITIAL TAKEAWAYS: 

After regorouping on our idea, we opted to focus on ATLAS as opposed to Hogwarts to add more uniqueness and relatability to our project. For our first check-in, we have attempted to display the first floor of ATLAS with simple animations. We were excited to find resources online with ample imagery and fonts to give the map as close a feel as the original Maurauder's Map. However, we felt like we owed the project some orignality and have adapted our goals to showcase numerous floors of the ATLAS building that are navagable via staircases.

### DEVELOPMENT PROCESS: 

We began our initial conversations via Zoom and pondering whether our idea had been done before. To our surpise, it seems a handful of people have created similar experiences and this led us back to the drawing board. We decided to pivot to creating a tailored Maurauder's Map experience to ATLAS students. What might they find useful about a map of the building? To keep things playful, we decided that creating showing professors walking through the halls might be a fun experience and perhaps we could even add additional information if the student were to click on the professors name. 

As we continue to think of new features to enhance our project, we wanted to get started with the basics by creating an initial shell. Therefore, we began by researching architectural renderings of the ATLAS building and to our surpise each floor was found online. For this check-in we tested our the first floor of the building to see if we could generate a version of the map that had the basic functions of the map we aspire to create.

There are many fascets to the project that cause challenges. In particular, with only the initial page created, we were faced with the challenge of implementing our ATLAS images via URL and are still having a hard time perfectly aligning each png. Because we were able to discover similar projects, we would like to beef ours up by making it as different as possible. We'd like to enhance our designs using procreate and see how far we can push ourselves with the animations that transition from floor-to-floor.

## Milestone 4
### REFLECTION: 

As I mentioned, previous group projects have been a massive challenge for me. However, this group disproved my theory that group projects are the worst. We worked incredibly well together and followed along with our established roles from start to finish. What blew me away, was that we all equally put in work and teamed up to find solutions to our problems. We had several challenges processing our code. For example, it was incredibly difficult to find a solution to our on click stair function while allowing for each image panel to link together. We worked for 4 hours together on a Zoom call and agreed to grab dinner and work on solutions seperately. We planned to get together later in the evening to bring to the group the solutions we tested. This was the best decision for our group. Grinding away seperately helped us try unique solutions and Megan discovered a working solution that helped us create our final product. Another challenge we had was having the stairs disappear when the map was closed. I discovered the solution when we took our dinner break after playing with the CSS file. Ultimatley, I believe this project taught me a lot about branches and forking in GitHub. It also was a great lesson to see how other people approach coding problems. In the end, I believe the biggest lesson was stepping away. The more you stare at the code, the harder it is to find a solution. Walking away and regrouping saved our project!
